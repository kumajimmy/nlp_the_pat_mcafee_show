# Natural Language Processing Project on The Pat McAfee Show (ON-GOING)

This repo contains a jupyter notebook outlining the steps taken to gain insight, using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), how Pat McAfee has become one of the most viewed and widely followed sport personalities.
The reason behind this is because the Pat Mcafee Show has gained so much popularity that much sports news gets broken on his show live (eg Shams Charania on the NBA); Pat has also entered this world in a non-traditional format, circumventing companies such as ESPN and The Atheletic, making his rise to fame very unique.
